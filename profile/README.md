## What is Barklarm?

Barklarm is a cross-platform app created using electron that allows you to add notifications to your computer to understand better the real-time behavior of your system. You can observe your CI/CD deployments, alarms, metrics, etc.

## Is Barklarm for me?

If you are running production services and want to be able to react as soon as possible to issues without the mental bandwidth of checking different places manually, I would say yes!

## Ready to get started?
